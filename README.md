# Travel-Light
This Project is a HTML and JavaScript based project. This Website is about finding affordable and interesting places to explore in three countries (Tokyo, Paris and London). I decided to create this website based off my own experience, finding it a bit difficult, in finding interesting places in a specific country of my own choosing.
